..........Done calculating R0 for MQ7!.
MQ7 initialized!

************************************************************************************************************************************************
MQ sensor reading library for arduino
Note: remember that all the parameters below can be modified during the program execution with the methods:
setR0, setRL, setA, setB where you will have to send as parameter the new value, example: mySensor.setR0(20); //R0 = 20KΩ
Authors: Miguel A. Califa U - Yersson R. Carrillo A - Ghiordy F. Contreras C
Contributors: Andres A. Martinez - Juan A. Rodríguez - Mario A. Rodríguez O 
Sensor: MQ-7
Supply voltage: 5.00 VDC
ADC Resolution: 12 Bits
R0: 23.43 KΩ
RL: 10.00 KΩ
Model: Exponential
MQ-7 -> a: 99.04 | b: -1.52
